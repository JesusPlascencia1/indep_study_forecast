# indep_study_forecast
Independent Study forecasting data and code work. In this repository there are three main files. The first is the code I used to clean the FDIC Call reports data (File name: "Final_dataset.ipynb'). The second is the final dataset itself called 'df_EDA.' The third mainf file is the exploratory analysis were I show distributions, relationships, and correlations. I have done an exploratory model, which was heavily inspired by CAMELS but I am running into two problems. First, I can no longer commit changes, and second my files are too large to attach directly to GitHub. I made changes to the all three of the main files and was only able to manually attach the EDA file. I am in the process of identifying my problem with GitHub, but until then, please note that my EDA Python Notebook is using my new dataset that is an extension of 'df_EDA' except with the edition of time variables.
